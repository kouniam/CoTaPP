Latest version on Tue Mar 2 16:36:23 2021

This is the code and main body for Project 1 of CoTaPP.

The game is called "GUESS WHAT?", and is a quizz-type game 
with multiple categories. We recommend you use Spyder 3.8 to
run the code, as this is what we tested it with. We also recommend
adjusting the IPython console to match the output formating of
the game for a better user experience.

Thank you for playing!
