# CoTaPP

This repository contains four example projects of Python scripting. These were done as milestone projects for the course *Computational Thinking and Programming with Python*.

* A1_Text_Quizz - This is a simple text based quizz game that is meant to highlight conditional scripting. It was fun to make and also includes a leaderboard.
* A2_Coffee_Extended - A script that was meant to create pairings for online casual chats (since COVID deprived us of random coffee meetings).
* A3_Analysis_Notebook - A jupyter notebook report that explores an education dataset from the CBS (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistie). Meant to highlight data analysis methods and visualizations.
* A4_Grid_Path - A simple, interactive pathfinder "game" that showcases GUI making (using Tkinter) and algorithmic thinking to find an optimal path.
